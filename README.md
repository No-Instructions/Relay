Relay is a collaborative editing plugin for Obsidian by [System 3](https://system3.md/). It uses CRDTs to enable snappy, local-first, real-time and asynchronous collaboration.

[Join our Discord](https://discord.system3.md) for support and a good time.

### How does Relay work?

In a nutshell, Relay:

1. **Tracks updates to designated folders**. The plugin uses conflict-free replicated data types (CRDTs) to track updates to folders that you designate within your vault.
2. **Relays updates.** It sends those updates up to Relay servers 🛰️, which then echo the updates out to all collaborators on the relay.
3. **Integrates updates.** Your collaborator receives the updates and integrates them seamlessly as they come in.

### What's a CRDT?

Great question. CRDT stands for **conflict-free replicated data type** and it's a technology that's critical to making local-first real-time collaboration work.

> The fundamental idea is this: You have data. This data is stored on multiple replicas. CRDTs describe how to coordinate these replicas to always arrive at a consistent state. [1]

2. Grab the share key
3. Give it to your people

### Collaborate to your heart's content

-   If you're in a note at the same time, you'll see each others' cursors
-   You can edit the same block at the same time (magic of CRDTs)
-   You can edit offline and it'll all be fine when you come back on (CRDTs ftw)
-   If you hit any bugs or have questions/requests let us know in the [Discord](https://discord.system3.md)

### Kick user from a relay

-   Right now anyone with the share key can join the relay
-   So you can kick the user but they could rejoin if they want
-   We'll be adding stricter sharing options in the future

2. Use it to join their relay
3. Add the folders you want to your vault

### Destroy the relay when you're done

If you're the owner of a relay, you can destroy the copy on the server.

If you're a member but not the owner, you can leave the relay (destroy your connection to the server), and you can destroy the local data.

### Do I need to be online to use Relay?

Relay is local-first -- this means that all of your edits are tracked locally and the server is used to _relay_ the edits to your collaborators. You can work offline and your edits will be merged once you come back online.

### How are edits merged?

We use a **Conflict-Free Replicable Data Types** (CRDTs) provided by the excellent yjs library.

### Is Relay Open Source?

The Obsidian plugin code is MIT licensed (this repo).

The [Relay Server](https://github.com/No-Instructions/y-sweet) is a fork of y-sweet and is MIT licensed. 

Our login, permissions, and billing server code is proprietary.


### Can I self-host?

We support "On-Prem" deployment of a Relay Server.

If you self-host your Relay Server on a private network then your users will still perform login and permissions checks through our servers, but they will connect directly to your server. Your content will be completely private and inaccessible by us.

For instructions on hosting your Relay Server on fly.io, see [Relay Server Template](https://github.com/No-Instructions/relay-server-template).

[Join our Discord](https://discord.system3.md) for help on configuring your on-prem deployment.
